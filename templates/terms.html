            <p>Welcome to FAMJAM ("we," "us," or "our"). These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of our application and services (collectively, the "Service"). Please read these Terms carefully before using the Service.</p>
            <p>By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

            <h2>1. Description of Service</h2>
            <p>FAMJAM is a digital platform designed to help families manage chores, habits, rewards, and track moods in a collaborative and engaging way. The Service allows a primary user ("Parent") to create a family group and invite other users ("Children") to participate.</p>

            <h2>2. User Accounts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Parent Accounts:</strong> You must be at least 18 years of age to create a Parent account. As a Parent, you are responsible for all activity that occurs under your family group, including the activity of any Child accounts you invite. You are responsible for obtaining consent from any co-parent or legal guardian before adding a Child to the Service.</li>
                <li><strong>Child Accounts:</strong> Child accounts may only be created through an invitation from a Parent. Children using the service must have the consent of their parent or legal guardian.</li>
                <li><strong>Account Security:</strong> You are responsible for safeguarding your password and for any activities or actions under your account. You agree to notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your account.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>
            <p>You and your family members will create content within the Service, including but not limited to chore lists, habit trackers, reward requests, personal notes, and mood entries ("User Content"). You retain all ownership rights to your User Content. However, by creating User Content, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute that content solely for the purpose of operating and providing the Service to you and your family group.</p>

            <h2>4. Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Features</h2>
            <p>Our Service utilizes third-party artificial intelligence services (provided by OpenAI) to offer certain features, such as the "FamJam Plan" generator and "AI Insights" for mood tracking.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you use these features, certain data (such as family goals, child usernames, and mood log entries) is sent to OpenAI to generate a response.</li>
                <li>The output from these AI features is generated automatically and is for informational and entertainment purposes only. We do not guarantee its accuracy, appropriateness, or quality.</li>
                <li>You are responsible for reviewing and editing any AI-generated content before applying it. We are not liable for any actions taken based on AI-generated suggestions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>5. User Conduct</h2>
            <p>You agree not to use the Service to create, upload, or share any content that is unlawful, harmful, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to remove any content and terminate accounts that violate these terms.</p>

            <h2>6. Termination</h2>
            <p>You can terminate your account at any time by contacting us. We may also suspend or terminate your account if you violate these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease, and we may permanently delete your account and all associated data.</p>

            <h2>7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided "AS IS," without any warranties of any kind. We do not warrant that the service will be uninterrupted or error-free. In no event shall FAMJAM be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages arising out of or in connection with your use of the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>The Mood Tracker feature is not a medical device and does not provide medical advice.</strong> It is intended for informational and self-awareness purposes only. If you are struggling with your mental health, please consult a qualified healthcare professional.</p>

            <h2>8. Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Terms on this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

            <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
            <p>If you have any questions about these Terms, please contact us at: <a href="mailto:oblivio.company@gmail.com">oblivio.company@gmail.com</a>.</p>
